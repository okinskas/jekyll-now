My Java Flip Tile project. Download/clone the repository.

```bash
$ mvn clean install

$ java --jar target/fliptile-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar 
```

You will see the game with a blank board of tiles.

Click on tiles to flip the colour of each tile along with the tiles touching each side.

Once all tiles have been flipped to black -- you win! Click OK to start again.
